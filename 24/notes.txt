meta programming is programming that creates other program.

Ruby has just a single underlying class and object structure.

each object has a few flags, member variables and a ref to class object.

a class has method definition and a ref to super class

metod calling mechanism:
any time a method is called, ruby looks for the method in the built in read-only variable self's class object. if it finds the method there, it calls it. if it cannot find it, it goes to its super class and tries to find the method/variable.
