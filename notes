#String
double quotes "ex" ruby does substituion and interpolation. substitues backslashes such as \n, interpolates expressions #{expressions}.
single quotes 'ex' ruby does minimal amount of work.

#puts vs p
if to_s is not implemented puts only prints #<ClassName, UniqueId> for an object
p prints internal fields of an object

# array
a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
# access array using [] operator
# last index = -1
a[-1]
a[-99] #nil

#[start_index, element_count]
a[1, 3]

#[start_index..end_index]
a[1..3]

#assign
a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
a[1] = 'bat'
a[-3] = 'cat'
a[3] = [9, 8] #add an array on index 3

a = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]
a[2, 2] = 'cat'
a[2, 0] = 'dog'
a[1, 1] = [9, 8, 7]
a[0..3] = []
a[5..6] = 99, 98

#hash
ruby retrives elements in the order they were inserted.
